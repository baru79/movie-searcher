Create an app for searching movies, using https://www.omdbapi.com

## Requirements

✅ You need to show an input to search for the movie and a button to search.</br>
✅ List the movies and show the title, year and poster.</br>
✅ Make the form work.</br>
✅ Make movies display in a responsive grid.</br>
✅ Fetch data to the API.</br>

## Nice to have

✅ Avoid doing the same search twice in a row.</br>
✅ Have the search done automatically when typing.</br>
✅ Prevents the search from being done continuously when typing (debounce).</br>
